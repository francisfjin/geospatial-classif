# Geospatial_SocioeconomicMobility

The issue this project addresses is socioeconomic mobility amongst minority communities across America. 

Specifically attempting to answer the following questions: 

1. What attributes about a given community have the biggest impact on the socioeconomic mobility of its children?
2. Given data on those attributes, can we predict the level of socioeconomic mobility of children from that community? 
3. What key visualizations can we create to portray this on a community-level in the US? 

Conclusions will provide insight into geographical variation, trends amongst communities, and important factors to children rising out of poverty, thus informing potential targeted solutions for minority communities and future policy reform.
